# What defined work-based learning?

## The Course Outcomes (COs) are designed primarily to support student transfer to universities rather than direct employment. Therefore, integrating Work-Based Learning (WBL) activities is essential to align coursework with employer expectations and industry needs.

# WBL activities - example

## Resume building -> Graded activity
## Guest speaker - one page summary to be written by a student - graded
## Provide graded activities where students create a Handshake account and explore career opportunities that match their interests.
## Collaborate with Advancing San Diego (for internships) and CareerWorks to offer free additional training opportunities.
## Real world tools - use of AI tools as an assistant. Create prototype.
